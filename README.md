# Front-end Boilerplate using Sass and Gulp 4

Using a set of boilerplate files when you're starting a website project can be a huge time-saver. Instead of having to start from scratch or copy and paste from previous projects, you can get up and running in just a minute or two.

I wanted to share my own boilerplate that I use for simple front-end websites that use HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. And I'm using Gulp 4 to compile, prefix, and minify my files.
